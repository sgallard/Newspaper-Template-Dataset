# Dataset used in work titled: A Graph-Matching Based Article Template Recommendation System for Newspaper Editors

## Description
- In the folder `json-augmented-dataset` you can find the JSON dataset of templates. All templates inside were used to train LayoutGMN. Only templates outside `XXXXXX` folders, where `X={0,1}`, were used for clustering and recommendation.  Each template folder has its 
respective JSON file and an abstract image representation.
- In the folder `userstudy-images` you can find the PNG images of realistic renders of each template, that we used in our online experiment.
- In the folder `usage` you can find CSV files with the overall usage of templates for both distributions presented in the paper (ODD and ISD).
